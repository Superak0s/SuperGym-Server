// src/jobs/sessionCleanup.ts

// Server-side backstop for abandoned workout sessions.
//
// The client already has its own 30-minute inactivity auto-end
// (WorkoutContext's checkAndEndStaleSession), but that only runs while the
// app is open. If the user force-closes the app, the phone dies, or the OS
// kills the JS process mid-workout, that logic never fires and the session
// — and the day it belongs to — stays "open" in the DB indefinitely. This
// job is the server-side equivalent: it runs on its own schedule regardless
// of whether any client is connected, and closes anything that's gone
// quiet for too long.
